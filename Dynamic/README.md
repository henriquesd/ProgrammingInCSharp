# Dynamic

Programming languages are divided into two types:
- Statically-typed languages: C#, Java
- Dynamically-typed languages: Ruby, JavaScript, Python

What's the difference?
	Type Resolution
	- Static languages: at compile-time
		- In static languages - resolution of types, members, properties, methods, is done at compile-time. So if you try to
		access a method that is not defined in an object, when we compile the application, we are getting an immediate feedback
		that's telling us that method or property is not found on that object.
	- Dynamic languages: at run-time
		- With dynamic languages - the resolution of types, properties, members, methods, is done at run-time.

Benefits
- Static languages: early feedback (compile-time).
- Dynamic languages: easier and faster to code (but on the flip side, because we loose compile-time checking, we have
to write more unit tests to make sure the application behaves properly at run-time).

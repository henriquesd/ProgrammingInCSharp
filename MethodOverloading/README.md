Method Overloading

A method is a code block that contains a series of statements.

Every method has a 'signature'
- Just like your signature, it is unique to the method
- Can be used to identify the method

Multiple methods can be created using the same name
- As long as the signatures are unique

We can 'overload' methods based on their unique signatures
- For the purpose of overloading, a method's signature is its name and the parameters it accepts
- public string AddRecord(int a, string) (the method's signature is "AddRecord(int a, string b)")

# Events

- A mechanism for communication between objects
- Used in building Loosely Coupled Applications ()
- Helps extending applications

Events is a mechanism for communication between objects (that means when something happens inside an object, it can notify
other objects about that).
Why do we need that? Because it can help building Loosely Coupled Applications.
What is Loosely Coupled Applications? That means an application, that its components or classes are not tightly coupled together.
A loosely coupled application is easy to extend without breaking or changing one or more of its existing capabilities.

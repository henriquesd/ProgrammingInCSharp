# Override

The override modifier is required to extend or modify the abstract or virtual implementation of an inherited method, property,
indexer, or event.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- An override method provides a new implementation of a member that is inherited from a base class.
- Overriding a method requires the use of two keywords
	- The base method that is being replaced, or overriden, must include the keyword 'virtual'
	- The overriding method must include the keyword 'override'

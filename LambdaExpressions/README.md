# Lambda Expressions

An anonymous method
- No access modifier
- No name
- No return statement

Lambda Expression is nothing but an anonymous method. That is a method that has no access modifier (like public or private), and has no name, and has no return statement.

Why do we use them?
For convenience. We can write less code and achieve the same thing, plus our code would be more readable.

# LINQ

Language Integrated Query (LINQ)

Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) is the name for a set of technologies based on the integration of query capabilities directly
into the C# language. Traditionally, queries against data are expressed as simple strings without type checking at compile time
or IntelliSense support. Furthermore, you have to learn a different query language for each type of data source: SQL databases,
XML documents, various Web services, and so on. With LINQ, a query is a first-class language construct, just like classes,
methods, events.

For a developer who writes queries, the most visible "language-integrated" part of LINQ is the query expression. Query
expressions are written in a declarative query syntax. By using query syntax, you can perform filtering, ordering, and
grouping operations on data sources with a minimum of code. You use the same basic query expression patterns to query and
transform data in SQL databases, ADO .NET Datasets, XML documents and streams, and .NET collections.

LINQ - Language Integrated Query

Similar to MySQL - works on Collections
- Three basics operations:
	- Get the Source
	- Create the Query
	- Execute the Query

Anatomy of a Query:
- Define the source - from ... in ...
- Define some conditions - where ...
- Take the filtered output - select ...

What is LINQ?
- Stands for: Language Integrated Query
- Gives you the capability to query objects in C# natively

With LINQ you can query:
- Objects in memory, eg collections (LINQ to Objects)
- Databases (LINQ to Entities)
- XML (LINQ to XML)
- ADO.NET Data Sets (LINQ to Data Sets)
